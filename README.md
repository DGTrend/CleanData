# CleanData

 Script for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
 
 Goals: 
 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 


#Method

Open files



Read train and test data



Read field's names

Field subset with mean and std



Clean train and test data sets from double/triple spaces

Write combined data with appropriate fields' names




Pick up clean dataset



Get lables and put names to them

Get subjects for train and test




Merge activities and subject to data, filter fields with std,mean,Mean



#ITEM 5 

generate command for last set


Build group for summarization (Activity by Subject for mean of variables)


Grouping data


Calculatiion of means for the grouping (generated in comm + formating)


put results to file AVG_BY_Activity_Subject.txt
